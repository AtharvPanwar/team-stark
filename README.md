Smart AI Drone for Leaf-Level Precision Spraying

Sep 2025 - PresentSep 2025 - Present
A modular drone system that captures leaf images, runs AI-based infection detection at a central hub, and sends precise spray commands to the drone’s 1-axis spray arm — spraying only infected plants, not entire fields.

Hardware 
- 1-axis spray and esp32cam arm. 
ESP32-CAM for image capture 
Raspberry Pi 5 for on-site processing
 
Software & AI 
- Image Processing: OpenCV and a 
lightweight model [or direct GPT API on 
esp (easy approach) ] for infection and 
data 
- A web-based dashboard for real-time 
monitoring, live mapping, and emergency 
controls.
 
Process Flow 
The system follows a continuous loop of 
Capture » Analyze » Decide » Command » Execute » Log

🚀 Potential Impact 
Our solution directly addresses the core problem of indiscriminate pesticide use. 
Reduces Farmer Costs: Drastically cuts down pesticide expenses by up to 50% through targeted spraying. 
Saves Labor & Time: Automates the manual, labor-intensive process of inspecting and spraying fields. 
Boosts Crop Yield: Ensures timely and precise treatment of infected plants, leading to healthier crops and better harvests.
 
🎯 Key Benefits 
Economic: Increases profit margins and supports the financial sustainability of small and marginal farmers. 
Environmental: Protects soil and water from chemical contamination and safeguards beneficial organisms like pollinators. 
Social: Contributes to a safer food supply by reducing pesticide residue, benefiting both farmers and consumers
